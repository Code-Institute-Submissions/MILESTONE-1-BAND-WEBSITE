# Band Website "The Monkees"

This is a MILESTONE project from the course Fullstack Web Developer from Code Institute.
Using the content learned from HTML5 CSS3 and User Centric Frontend Development modules from the course.

This project consist in produce a Website for the band "The Monkees" with the knowledge adquired in these modules
 
## UX
 
After visit other bands Websites I get some Ideia of what these Websites want archieve.
With this I understand about the menu types they are using today and how archieve a good user experience while browse the website.

I choose to use the sticky menu on this website with the logo in the center.
After this I added some hover effects in the text and image. And I revert the logo image using a red instead yellow.

In some bands websites I saw the ideia to use "cards" from bootstrap to play the music, while this website doesn't have many music, I can use just the cards without the carrousel effect from b4

The Wireframe can be founded in the wireframe folder.

## Features

- Hover effects from the menu
- Music cards
- Video Clip
- contact form with b4

### Features Left to Implement
- lightbox with the videos of the band
